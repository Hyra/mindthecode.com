I just want to mention [CabinJS](http://www.cabinjs.com). It took me all of 10 minutes to set it up, and another 10 to get the automatic deployment to Github Pages working. The other 4 hours this sunday I spent on _layouting_, _designing_ and _tweaking_ the blog you're reading now.

And that's pretty sweet.

There's quite a few **static site generators** on the market today, of which [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) probably is the most famous, but CabinJS elevates a minimalistic setup combined with Grunt tasks to a new level of awesomeness. You can focus on writing your posts, instead of configuring your generator.

If you're looking for a blog generator that uses Grunt for:

- Auto reloading
- SASS compiling
- Deploying to Github, Amazon S3 or FTP

.. make sure to [CabinJS](http://www.cabinjs.com) a try.
