I decided to have a look at Twitter Bootstrap 2, and had it run through my LESS Component. I then realized the component didn't support subfolders!

So this is just to let you guys know I wrote a small tweak, and now it works perfectly :)

If you have any other alterations you would like to see feel free to fork, or drop me a comment below.

The new version: <https://github.com/Hyra/less>
