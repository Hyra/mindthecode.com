Markdown rocks. I lately fell in love with it when I was setting up this very blog. You can just write easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text files, and Markdown takes care of the rest.

For this blog I had used a Markdown script I found that parses plain text and outputs it as HTML. It allows me to write posts in a simple/plain format and just pump it into the database `as is`. For a while I wanted to make it into a more solid CakePHP Helper. And today I did. Setting it up couldn't be simpler, and using it is a matter of adding it as a call in your views.

I put it on Github @ [Markdown for CakePHP][1] along with the necessary instructions and usage example.

Hope you enjoy it, and if you have any suggestions or tips, don't hesitate to leave a comment or Fork it.
